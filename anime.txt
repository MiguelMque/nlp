The word anime is the Japanese term for animation, which means all forms of animated media.[2] Outside Japan, anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.[3][4] The culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan.[5][6][7] Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product.[4] Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism.[8]

The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by way of television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.
